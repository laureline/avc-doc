Migration from release-2.51 to release-2.52
===========================================

* Get the server tag 2.52 from the svn trunk
* Configure univrav.properties and web.xml
* Generate and deploy the war with ant and tomcat
* Use the tool "avc_encode_webm" to encode old videos into webm and mp4 (for html5)
* Ogv are now useless. You can remove all ogv if you want. we provide a script for making this operation /documentation/Tools/FindOgv/findogv.sh.
* If you have some courses with subtitles, you can generate subtitles for the html5 
  page with the script "to_srt.py" (see in the "scripts" folder of the univrav folder). We provide a script to create srt files for old videos :/documentation/Tools/XmlToSrt/xmltosrt.sh.
